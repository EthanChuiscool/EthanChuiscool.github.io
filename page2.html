        <h1>Backing Up of Data</h1>
<p>This website covers the many forms of <strong>secondary storage</strong> and compares the advantages and disadvantages 
    of each type. We will consider a number of storage devices later but first it is important to consider why we need to 
    back up data using these devices and also how data is accessed.</p>
    <h2>What Is Backing Up Data?</h2>
    <p><strong>Backing up</strong> refers to the copying of files/data to a different medium (disk, tape, flash drive, etc. 
        ) in case of a problem with the main secondary storage device.
        Backing up files and data on a regular basis is seen as good computing practice and many computer 
        systems can be set to back up files automatically on a regular basis. An example would be the use 
        of magnetic tapes to back up internet servers on a regular basis, or cloud storage companies using 
        magnetic tape or hard disk drives to back up clients' data on a regular basis.
        The backups are often stored in a different place to the main storage. This is in case of fire or 
        some other situation that could lead to irretrievable loss of key data/files.</p>
        <h2>Why Back Up Data?</h2>
        <p>There are various reasons why backups are made. Some of the more common reasons are considered 
            below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To safegauard against loss of data due to the failure of the original secondary storage device;
                    this could be due to hardware failure (e.g. head crash on a hard drive unit), problems caused 
                    by files being overwritten accidentally (or otherwise) or possible corruption of files (for example, caused by power surges).</li>
                <li>To safeguard against damage caused by hackers. This may not be their intention (they may only 
                    want to gain access to the information for other purposes, for example to find personal 
                    information such as bank account details). However, the very act of hacking in to files could 
                    cause problems such as corruption or data loss.</li>
                <li>Backups are also made in case the files need to be used elsewhere; this protects the originals 
                    against possible corruption or loss.</li>
                <li>Backups don't necessarily guard against the effect of a virus. The virus could attach itself to the 
                    files, which could mean that the backups are also affected. If the computer was ‘cleaned’ of the 
                    virus and then the backup files reloaded, there is a real risk that the virus could infect the 
                    computer system again. The best protection is not to get a virus in the first place.</li>
            </ul>
