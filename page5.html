        <h1>Secondary Storage Media Part (Optical)</h1>
        <h2>Optical Storage Media</h2>
        <div class = text>
        <h3>CD/DVD Disks</h3>
        <img src="images/spiral-removebg-preview.png" alt="Spiral"
              style="width:180px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;">
        <p>CDs and DVDS are described as optical storage devices. Laser light is used to read data and to 
            write data on the surface of the disk. Both CDs and DVDs use a thin layer of metal alloy or 
            light-sensitive organic dye to store the data.
            As can be seen from the diagram, they use a single spiral track that runs from the centre of the 
            disk to the edge.
            The data is stored in ‘pits’ and ‘bumps’ on the spiral track. A red laser is used to read and write 
            the data. CDs and DVDs can be designated as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>R — write once only</li>
                <li>ROM — can only be read</li>
                <li>RW — can be written to or read from many times.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>DVD technology is slightly different to that used in CDs. One of the main differences is the use 
            of <strong>dual-layering</strong>, which considerably increases the storage capacity. Basically, 
            this means that there are two individual recording layers. The Evo layers of a standard 
            DVD are joined together with a transparent (polycarbonate) spacer; a very thin reflector 
            is also sandwiched between the Evo layers. Reading and writing of the second layer is 
            done by a red laser focusing at a fraction of a millimetre difference compared to the 
            first layer. Standard, single-layer DVDs still have a larger storage capacity than CDs 
            because the ‘pit’ size and track width are both smaller. This means that more data can be 
            stored on the DVD surface. DVDs use lasers with a wavelength of 650 nanometers CDs use 
            lasers with a wavelength of 780 nanometers. The shorter the wavelength of the laser light, 
            the greater the storage capacity of the medium.
            </p>
<h3>CD-ROM and DVD-ROM</h3>
<p>These optical disks are read-only memory (ROM), which means they cannot  be written over and can 
    only be read. The data is stored as a series of <strong>pits</strong> (equivalent to a binary value of 1 ) and <strong>lands</strong> 
    (equivalent  to the binary value of 0) in the metallic optical layer. The ‘pits’ are formed  by a 
    laser beam etching the surface
    at the manufacturing  stage. Only a single track exists which spirals out from the centre of the 
    disk.
    The ‘pits’ and ‘lands’ are read by a low-powered laser beam that follows the data stream and reads 
    from the centre outwards in a spiral. The light reflects differently off a  bit’ than it does off a 
    ‘land’ and this is interpreted  as 1s and 0s (that is, data) — hence the term digital media.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>CD-ROMs are used to  store music files, software, computer games and reference software 
            (such as an encyclopaedia).</li>
        <li>DVD-ROMs have much larger storage and are used to store films, computer data and ever-more 
            sophisticated computer/arcade games.
            </li>
        <li>CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs are used in applications where there is a real need to prevent the 
            deletion or overwriting of important data.
            </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>They hold far more data than Floppy disks (one CDJ DVD could replace several floppy disks 
            in some applications).</li>
        <li>They are less expensive than hard disk drive systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The data transfer rate/data access time is slower than for hard disks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CD-R and DVD-R</h3>
    <p>The letter R here means the disk is recordable only <em>once</em>; it becomes a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. once it has been finalised (this means that the CD/DVD cannot have any additional data written to it). This is the last step in the CD/DVD process; finalising is also used as an alternative word for the ‘closing’ of a CD-R, in which Table of Contents  (TOC) data.are written on the disc to enable the computer to read the CD/DVD.
        A thin layer of an organic dye (DVDs also use an additional silver alloy or gold reflector) is used 
        as the recording media. A laser beam produces <strong>heated spots</strong> and <strong>unheated spots</strong>. On reading the 
        disk, a laser beam is capable of distinguishing between the two types of spots and effectively 
        reads the data stream from the centre outwards in a spiral action. This data is then interpreted as 
        1s  and 0s.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Home recordings of music (CD-R) and films (DVD-R).</li>
        <li>Used to  store data to be kept for later use or to be transférred to  another computer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheaper than RW disks.</li>
        <li>Once burned (and finalised) they are like a ROM.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If finalised, the CD-R/DVD-R can only be recorded on once, if an error in the data has 
            occurred then the disk has to be discarded since it can no longer be written to.
            </li>
        <li>Not all CD/DVD players can read CD-R/DVD-R.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CD-RW and DVD-RW</h3>
    <p>The RW means:these disks are a rewritable media and can be written over several times. Unlike 
        CD-R/DVD-R, they don't become ROMs. The recording.layer uses a special phase-changing metal alloy 
        (often GeSbTe [Germanium-Antimony-Terbium alloy]; a number of different methods are used to  
        produce these alloys). The alloy can switch between crystalline phase and amorphous phase (non- 
        crystalline), thus changing its reactivity to light depending on the laser beam power. <strong>Spots</strong> are produced that can be read by a laser and then interpreted as 1s and 0s. The system allows data to  be written, erased and rewritten many times.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used to record television programmes (like a video recorder), which can be recorded over 
            time and time again.</li>
        <li>Not  as wasteful as R format as more files/data can be added to at a later stage 
            (with CD-R/DVD-R it is only possible to do a write operation once if you have already 
            finalised the disc).</li>
            <li>Used in CCTV systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can be written over many times.</li>
        <li>Can use different file formats each time it is used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can be relatively expensive.</li>
        <li>It is possible to accidentally overwrite data.</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>DVD-RAM</h3>
        <p><strong>DVD-RAM</strong> uses a very different technology to CDs and DVDs. They have the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Instead of a single, spiral track, they use a number of concentric tracks</li>
        <li>the use of concentric tracks allows simultaneous read and write operations to take place</li>
        <li>they allow numerous read.and write operations (up to 100 000 times) and have great longevity 
            (over 30 years), which makes them ideal for archiving
            </li>
        <li>DVD-RAMs can be written to and read from many times.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The recording layer is made from a similar phase-changing material as used in RW technology. When 
        writing, a laser heats the phase-changing alloy on the disk to about 500 °C to 700 °C changing the 
        reflective properties from shiny to dull (i.e. <strong>pits</strong>). If the disk needs to be erased; a laser heats the surface to about 200 °C to return the disk to its original shiny state. A low-power laser 
        is used to read the written marks on the surface. The shiny and dull marks (‘pits’) represent data 
        to a computer where they are interpreted.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>In recording devices such as satellite receivers to allow simultaneous recording and playback.</li>
        <li>Used in camcorders to store movies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>They have a long life (estimated 30 years minimum life).</li>
        <li>It is possible to do a rewrite operation over 100 000  times (compare this to the RW format, 
            which only allows about 1000 rewrites).</li>
        <li>Writing on DVD-RAMs is very reliable — they have in-built verification software, so the accuracy 
            of the data is ensured.
            </li>
        <li>Very fast access if the files are fairly small.</li>
        <li>No need to <strong>finalise</strong> the disk.</li>
        <li>Very large capacity (about 10 GB if double-sided format I is used).</li>
        <li>They offer the ability to read data at the same time as data is being written.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not as compatible as R or RW format; many systems won't recognise the DVD-RAM format.</li>
        <li>Relatively expensive (about four times the cost of a DVD-RW disk).</li>
        <li>they have been superseded by newer technologies such as solid state memories.
            </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Blu-ray Discs</h3>
<p><strong>Blu-ray discs</strong> are another example of optical storage media. However, they are 
    fundamentally different to DVDs in their construction and in the way they carry out read-write 
    operations. The main differences are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a blue laser, rather than a red laser, is used to carry out  read and write operations; the 
            wavelength of blue light is.only  405  nanometres  (compared  to 650 nanometres for red light)
            </li>
        <li>using blue laser light means that the ‘pits’ and ‘bumps’ can be much smaller; consequently, 
            Blu-ray can store up to five times more data than a normal DVD
            </li>
        <li>Blu-ray uses a single 1. l mm-thick polycarbonate disk; normal DVDs use a sandwich of two 0.6 mm 
            thick disks</li>
        <li>using two sandwiched layers can cause <strong>birefringence</strong>. 
            (light is retracted into two separate beams causing reading errors); 
            because Blu-ray uses only one layer, the disks don't suffer from birefringence</li>
        <li>Blu-ray discs automatically come with a secure encryption system, which helps to. prevent 
            piracy and copyright infringement.
            </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Home video consoles.</li>
        <li>Storing and playing back movies (one high-definition movie of two hours duration uses up 25 GB of 
            memory).
            </li>
        <li>PCs can use this technology for data storage or backing up hard drives.</li>
        <li>Camcorders can use this media (in cartridge form) to store movie footage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Very large storage capacity, therefore ideal for storing high-definition movies.</li>
        <li>Very fast data transfer rate.</li>
        <li>The data access speed is also greater than with other optical media.</li>
        <li>Blu-ray discs automatically come with a secure encryption system, which helps to prevent piracy and copyright infringement.</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Relatively expensive.</li>
        <li>Encryption problems (which are used to stop piracy) when used to store video.</li>
        <li>There are fewer movie titles on Blu-ray format, which is reducing its impact on the home  
            movie market.
            </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All these optical storage media are used as backup systems (for photos, music and multimedia 
        files). This also means that CDs and DVDs can be used to transfer files between computers. 
        Manufacturers often supply their software using CDs and DVDs. When the software is supplied in 
        this way, the disk is usually in a read-only format. The most common use of DVD and Blu-ray is 
        the supply of movies or games. The memory capacity of CDs isn't big enough to store most movies.
        </p>
        <h3>The Future of Optical Media</h3>
        <p>In recent times both the CD and DVD are showing signs of becoming obsolete. Many computer 
            systems now come with USB connectors  only and no DVD or CD drive. The main method of 
            transferring files between devices has become flash memory. Many people now store all 
            their music. in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>on hard disk drive systems In MP3 format on: a computer/tablet,
                     their mobile/smartphone,
                     a portable music player (such as an iPod)
                    </li>
                <li>using the ‘cloud’ to store all their files so they can access their music from anywhere in the 
                    world
                    </li>
                <li>by ‘streaming’ their music from the internet; provided the user has an internet connection they 
                    can access music through a laptop computer, mobile phone, tablet or any other receiving device.
                    </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is a similar story for movies, where streaming is becoming increasingly common. Many television 
                sets are now set up as ‘smart’ televisions — this means it is now possible to simply stream movies or television programmes on demand without the need for any DVD or Blu-ray players. Infact, the  television set has become the central computer with a link to the internet using wireless connection.
                Floppy disks met the same fate in the early twenty-first  century.  How often do you see floppy 
                disks? It  is very likely that CDs and DVDs will meet the same fate and be replaced by one of the 
                systems described above or something entirely new.
